This is a library for Reactive Programming extensions, layered on top of 
Microsoft's Rx library (the Rx library provides the System.Reactive namespace).

The basic idea is to promote events and event-like things to first-class citizens
in the language. You end up being able to compose, filter, aggregate, etc over 
events, making them a lot easier to work with.

And there's a pretty good introduction to it here - it does a really
good job using concrete examples to show why you'd want to use this stuff:
